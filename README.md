🐍 How to Play Snake and Ladders:
Players take turns rolling a dice and move forward by the number rolled.

If a player lands on the bottom of a ladder, they climb to the top.

If they land on the head of a snake, they slide down to the tail.

To win, a player must land exactly on square 100 — if the dice roll overshoots, they skip the turn.

Rolling a 6 gives another turn.

Simple, fun, and full of surprises! 🎲# snake-and-ladder
Snake and Ladder is a classic board game where players race to reach the 100th square by rolling a dice. Ladders boost progress upward, while snakes pull players back down.
